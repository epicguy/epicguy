### Diversion and side hobby: Sudoku
Took a little while, but I have successfully createad all 5B unique grids, using pure Javascript in 8 hours on a 64 core AWS EC2 instance.
I'll next look at a Javascript algorithim to create puzzles for each grid solution, with the minimun number of clues.
This involves the challenge of "covering" all the "unavoidable sets" for a given grid, in a minimum way.
Should be fun.
